## Speech Production

Most sounds are movements of the tongue and lips, which can be considered gestures forming particular sounds. That is, they are audible rather than visible gestures.

Respiratory system pushing air out of the lungs provides the energy required for speech sounds. Air goes up the trachea and into the larynx, then through the vocal folds. When the vocal folds are close together, they vibrate to form voiced sounds. When they are apart, the sounds are voiceless. 

Voiced vs voiceless can distinguish between words (or phonemes).

All the air passages above the lungs form the vocal tract. This includes the oral and nasal tracts. 

Speech production mechanism has four main processes:
 1. Airstream process (respiratory system pushing air out or in)
 2. Phonation process (actions of vocal folds, voicing)
 3. Oro-nasal process (does the air go out the nose or mouth)
 4. Articulatory process (tongue and lips interacting with roof of mouth and pharynx)
## Sound Waves 

Rather than simply describing how the sounds are made, we can also describe the sounds themselves with descriptions of the waves/acoustic structure. 
1. Pitch
2. Loudness
3. Quality (i.e. bad vs bud, variation in vowel quality)

Sound comes from rapid variations in air pressure caused by actions of vocal organs-- for example, vibrating vocal cords causes rapid alternation between higher and lower air pressure through the vocal tract. Then the air reaches the eardrums and causes them to vibrate. 

Ears break down sounds into different frequency components via auditory nerve. So to visualize that, we make a sound spectrogram. A spectrogram has time on the horizontal axis, frequency on the vertical axis, and amplitude in grayscale. This shows us the amplitude of different frequency components, and these amplitudes vary with time. 

## Places of Articulatory Gestures

Articulators are the parts of the vocal tract (upper and lower surfaces) used to form sounds. 

1. Upper Surface: upper lip, teeth, alveolar ridge, hard palate, soft palate (velum), uvula, pharynx
	1. When the velum presses against the back wall of the pharynx, it shuts off the nasal tract, creating velic closure
2. Lower Surface: lower lip, tongue tip, blade, front (body of tongue beneath the hard palate), center (between hard palate and soft palate), back (beneath soft palate), root, epiglottis

Diagrams show mid-sagittal view, but the vocal tract is a tube, and the sides of the tongue may vary to create different sounds too. 

Consonants classified by place and manner of obstruction of the airstream. Three primary articulators are the lips (labial), tip or blade of tongue (coronal), and back of tongue (dorsal). 

More specific places of articulation indicated by arrows from a lower articulator to an upper articulator.
1. Bilabial (upper and lower lips)
2. Labiodental (lower lip, upper front teeth)
3. Dental (tongue tip/blade and upper front teeth)
	1. Sometimes may describe American th that goes between the teeth (rather than behind) as interdental
4. Alveolar (tip/blade and alveolar ridge), compare ten (alveolar) to tenth (dental)
5. Retroflex (tongue tip and back of alveolar ridge): many English speakers don't use it at all. 
6. Post-alveolar (blade and back of alveolar ridge): sh sounds. Also called palato-alveolar
7. Palatal (front of tongue and hard palate): Consonant at the beginning of "you"
8. Velar (back of tongue and velum)

## The Oro-Nasal Process

Rang, ran, ram: the final consonants move forward from velar to alveolar to bilabial. In all three, the velum is lowered, obstructing the mouth to create a nasal consonant. Usually the velum is raised, obstructing the nose to create an oral consonant. 

## Manners of Articulation 

There are many ways of obstructing the air flow at any given place of articulation 
1. Stops: complete closure of the articulator so the airstream cannot escape.
	1. Oral stop: velum raised so the nasal tract is also blocked. When the articulators come apart, there is a small burst of sound. Also called a plosive. 
	2. Nasal stop: velum is lowered so air can still go out through the nose, such as "my" (bilabial) or "sang" (velar). These are generally called just "nasals" and the word stop usually refers to the former. 
2. Fricative: close approximation of articulators, airflow partially obstructed creating turbulent airflow.
	1. Hissing fricatives such as "s" and "sh" sometimes called sibilants
3. Approximant: articulators close together but the vocal tract isn't narrowed enough to create the turbulent airstream of a fricative. Consider "yacht" or "we" or "raw" (American English)
4. Lateral (approximant): Obstruction of airstream at the central of the oral tract, but incomplete closure on the sides. Consider "lie"
5. Additional Consonantal gestures
	1. Trill/roll 
	2. Tap/flap (i.e. the t in "pity" in American English)
	3. Affricate (stop into fricative rather than opening up completely), consider "church" and "judge"
	4. Glottal stop: used in the beginning of words that start with vowels "oak" "ark"

## The Acoustics of Consonants

Place of articulation not often clear on spectrogram, but manner (stop, nasal, fricative, approximant) and voice/voiceless are clear. Place of articulation more clear in spectrograms. 
## Articulation of Vowel Sounds

Unlike consonants, articulators don't come close together in vowels, and airstream is not that obstructed. Vowels are described in terms of highest point of tongue, and position of lips. 
1. Front vs back vowels (if the tongue is close to the front or back surface of vocal tract)
2. High vs low vowels (mouth opens more for low vowels)
3. Roundedness: lip rounding 

Limitations to this: for example the front high vowel "heed" is much higher than the back high vowel "food" and doesn't consider width of the pharynx. There are better ways using acoustics. 

## The Sounds of Vowels

Complex sounds with different simultaneous pitches, ie pitch that it's actually spoken and then overtone pitches depending on shape of vocal tract. You can hear the overtones if you whisper the heed hid head had sequence, cause now with no vocal cord vibration there's no base pitch. 
1. First formant: distinguishable in creaky voice, lower pitch, varies inversely with vowel height
2. Second formant: distinguishable in whisper, higher pitch, descends from front to back vowels
## Suprasegmentals 

Vowels and consonants are segments that compose speech. Suprasegmentals are superimposed on the syllables. Described in relation to other items in the same utterance (i.e. relative pitch, length, stress etc)
1. Stress-- can distinguish between nouns and verbs, or emphasis. Produced in English by loudness, exaggeration of vowel/consonant properties, exaggeration of pitch
2. Voice pitch (not overtone pitch) measured by frequency
	1. Pitch pattern in sentence is intonation. Can be used to indicate a question
