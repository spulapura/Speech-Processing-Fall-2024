# Chapter 2: Phonology and Phonetic Transcription

Citation style speech: style of speech where you show someone how to pronounce a word.
Connected speech: used in normal conversation. 
Broad transcription: transcribe based on which differences of articulation actually convey difference of meaning. For example, "tie" in English can be pronounced with the tip or blade of the tongue, and they do not affect the meaning of the word. 

Phonology describes the systems and patterns of sounds that occur in a language. Study the distributions of sounds in words, ie when the phonetic contrast does and does not convey a difference in meaning. 
1. Distinctiveness or contrast, when two sounds can differentiate a word. That makes the phonetic difference also a phonemic difference. For example "pill" and "lip" have different L sounds but they aren't phonemically different because "lip" and "llip" are not, and could not be words with different meanings

Phonemic transcriptions record all and ONLY variaions of sound that cause difference in meaning. It often can be different from spelling because pronunciation has changed over centuries in English.

## Transcription of Consonants

Can find consonants that are contrastive by finding sets of words that rhyme. Find a "minimal set" of words that differ from one another by one sound. 

IPA gives symbols for transcribing different sounds. Many are the same as the English pronunciation of the letter. But some additional symbols are needed, and some correspond to the sounds in other languages ie \[r] is a trill R rather than the English R, \[j] is a "y" sound like in German and Scandinavian languages.

Affricates have a digraph. Consider "white shoes" vs "why choose" you can see the difference of timing between the stop and the fricative. 

Glottal stops are contested as a consonant phoneme in English because of the limited distribution. But they do occur in vowel initial words, "butter" in London Cockney, glottalized t's in American cat, bat etc. 

Sometimes "weather" and "whether" can be a contrastive pair, when people pronounce the latter like hw. 
## Transcription of Vowels

Transcription of vowels is harder than consonants because there's a lot more accent variation in English in vowels, and authorities differ on how to appropriately describe vowels.

Can still make minimal sets and contrast the intervening vowel sound between fixed consonants. But note many vowel pronunciation differences between British and American English-- can't be transcribed the same way. But IPA symbols correspond to many languages with Roman alphabet writing, English spelling reflects old pronunciations. 

Seat/sit and heed/hid have different vowel quality and length, so they are represented by \[I] instead of \[i], sometimes with a colon to represent length (but that's not generally contrastive in English).

Hay, bait, they transcribed with \[eI] as a diphthong. Head and had transcribed with epsilon and ash respectively. Hoe and code have a diphthong-- schwa + "hood" vowel. Often times British English will use a diphthong where American English will use an r. Americans have a schwar for words like brother which end in schwa for British. 
## Consonant and Vowel Charts

1. Consonant chart-- Voiceless on left, voiced on right of each cell. Place of articulation from forward to back goes left to right on the horizontal axis. Manner of articulation on vertical axis. 
	1. W shows up in two places because it's obstructed in the lips and velum
	2. Affricates not listed because we wouldn't know whether to place them with the stop or the fricative element
2. Vowel chart-- front to back on the horizontal axis, high to low on the vertical axis. 
	1. Does not show roundedness or vowel length. 
## Phonology

Possible to include more phonetic info than a phonemic transcription. For example, hut and cat may be pronounced with or without the noisy puff of air at the end. They are in free variation-- you can use both and it doesn't make a difference in meaning. 

Returning to lip vs pill-- the velarized L occurs at the end of the word, while the regular one at the beginning. We have a complementary distribution when one sound occurs in one environment and the other occurs in a different environment. 

Another example, peak vs speak. The former is aspirated. These are allophones of the same phoneme because they are perceived as the same sound but occur in complementary distribution. 
1. Contrastive: occur in overlapping distributions, distinguishes meaning
2. Free variation: occur in the same environments, doesn't distinguish meaning
3. Complementary distribution/ allophones: never appear in the same environment. 

Note, these distributions occur in citation speech, they aren't the result of being sloppy or accidentally saying things wrong. 

Noncontrastive variation (free variation, complementary distribution) nevertheless are important because if you want to sound like a native speaker, you have to say the sounds in the correct distribution. 

Diacritics are small marks that can be used to increase precision of transcription. For example you can put a little circle under a consonant to indicate it is voiceless. So in the environment after the stop P, when the l becomes voiceless (ie play), we can mark that with the diacritic. A colon can be used to distinguish length. 

It's not always diacritics for allophones and phonemic contrasts with separate symbols. The American alveolar tap in letter/ladder is different enough from t and d that it has its own symbol. The standard t never occurs in this environment. 

Broad transcription uses the simplest possible set of symbols, narrow transcription shows the most phonetic detail with specific symbols/allophonic detail. A narrow transcription can still be phonemic rather than allophonic-- you can use a more specific symbol that describes a contrastive rather than allophonic sound. For example sheep vs ship, the /i/ quality is always also longer than the /I/ quality when they occur in the same context. So we can mark it as /i:/ to indicate the length in addition to quality. i.e. it's not indicating a difference between /i/ and /i:/ but rather more precisely describing that sound. 

This is different from the devoicing of L in please. Only in this specific context is the L pronounced this way. However, replacing it with the standard L doesn't change the meaning. So this is an allophonic narrow transcription. 

Every transcription should have two aspects:
1. Conventions that ascribe general phonetic values to symbols (approximate specification of articulations involved)
2. Implicit statements accompanying a transcription for interpreting the text. For example /i/ = /i:/ showing that /i/ is longer than /I/

Impressionistic transcription captures phonetic value rather than phonological, in situations where subject doesn't know which phonetic differences are contrastive.
