## Speech Production

Most sounds are movements of the tongue and lips, which can be considered gestures forming particular sounds. That is, they are audible rather than visible gestures.

Respiratory system pushing air out of the lungs provides the energy required for speech sounds. Air goes up the trachea and into the larynx, then through the vocal folds. When the vocal folds are close together, they vibrate to form voiced sounds. When they are apart, the sounds are voiceless. 

Voiced vs voiceless can distinguish between words (or phonemes).

All the air passages above the lungs form the vocal tract. This includes the oral and nasal tracts. 

Speech production mechanism has four main processes:
 1. Airstream process (respiratory system pushing air out or in)
 2. Phonation process (actions of vocal folds, voicing)
 3. Oro-nasal process (does the air go out the nose or mouth)
 4. Articulatory process (tongue and lips interacting with roof of mouth and pharynx)
## Sound Waves 

Rather than simply describing how the sounds are made, we can also describe the sounds themselves with descriptions of the waves/acoustic structure. 
1. Pitch
2. Loudness
3. Quality (i.e. bad vs bud, variation in vowel quality)

Sound comes from rapid variations in air pressure caused by actions of vocal organs-- for example, vibrating vocal cords causes rapid alternation between higher and lower air pressure through the vocal tract. Then the air reaches the eardrums and causes them to vibrate. 

Ears break down sounds into different frequency components via auditory nerve. So to visualize that, we make a sound spectrogram.
